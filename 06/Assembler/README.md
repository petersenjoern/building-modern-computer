# Python assembler 

Translates the *.asm file to *.hack file; hence reads assembly language and assembles to machine language code

how to use:
cd to 06/assembler
python .\assembler\assembling.py .\Pong.asm

this will generate the Pong.hack file

Use the by nand2tetris.org provider Assembler (in the tools folder) and load the source file (Pong.asm), load the comparison file (the previous generated Pong.hack file by the python assembler).
