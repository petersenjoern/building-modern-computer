1. In a Subfolder, write your jack code into a .jack file (e.g. folder HelloWorld with file Main.jack)
2. Use the Jackcompiler by nand2tetris JackCompiler.bat path/to/HelloWorld/Main.jack. This will compile the jack code to VM code
3. Take your written VMtranslator from chapter 07+08 and point it to the generated VM code, to obtain the .asm file
4. If you want to, you can take it even further from the .asm file..
